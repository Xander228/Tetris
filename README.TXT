# Tetris

A custom-built Tetris game using **Java Swing** for rendering and game logic. This project closely follows modern Tetris mechanics, implementing precise timing for piece movement, locking, and line clearing to create an authentic gameplay experience.

## Features
- **Smooth Piece Movement**: Supports auto-shift, soft drops, and hard drops.
- **Ghost Piece**: Displays where the current tetromino will land.
- **Lock Delay & Reset System**: Allows brief movement after a piece lands.
- **Randomized Piece Bag**: Ensures pieces do not occur too frequently in a row
- **Row Identification & Clearing**: Highlights full rows before clearing them.

## Technologies Used
- Java (Swing for UI rendering)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Custom game loop and timing logic

## How to Play
- **Arrow Keys**: Move pieces left or right
- **Down Arrow**: Soft drop
- **Up Arrow**: Rotate clockwise
- **Shift**: Hold Piece
- **Ctrl**: Rotate counterclockwise
- **Space**: Hard drop
